Dictionary
==========

A program to manage vocabularies for conlangs. All credit for the vast majority of this goes to @DoctorAlpaca, who wrote the original Dictionary program available [here](https://github.com/DoctorAlpaca/dictionary). I've only made a few bugfixes and tweaks, and am now publishing it here unless otherwise decided by @DoctorAlpaca.

##Installation

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/cofl/dictionary/releases). Make sure you have Java version 7 or later installed and open the .jar file. Alternatively, compile the program for yourself (see below).

## Compiling it yourself

This project uses Apache Maven to build. If you have Maven installed it should be as easy as using `$ mvn install` in the project directory.
